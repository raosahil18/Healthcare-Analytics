# Healthcare-Analysis using Tableau

## About Dataset
Within the Healthcare-Dataset, multiple columns offer detailed insights into patient health, encompassing age, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), skin thickness, and many more. This dataset presents an opportunity to delve into the intricate connections between these health indicators and whether the patients are diabetic or not. By conducting exploratory analysis, the project aims to uncover patterns, correlations, and predictive factors contributing to diabetes risk, thereby enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between health metrics and disease susceptibility.

## Details of data entries
###### Total Entries:  768 entries.
###### Columns: 9 columns 
1. ID: A unique identification for each Patient.
2. Age: Age in years.
3. Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. BMI:  Body mass index.
5. Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function, a genetic score of diabetes.
6. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
7. Insulin: Insulin level of the patient.
8. Outcome: : Binary classification indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.
9. Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness.
    
## Dashboard Components:

`View 1: Diabetic/Non-diabetic using Shapes`

Presented the percentage distribution of diabetic versus non-diabetic patients


` View 2: Patient summary by Blood Pressure category`

Displayed summary that provided a breakdown of patients into different blood pressure categories, allowing for easy identification of the distribution across various pressure levels.

`View 3: Histogram to show BMI by Age groups`
